    "description": "Matthew 21:33-46\n\nThe Parable of the Tenants\n“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.\n\n“The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.\n\n“But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’ So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n\n“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”\n\n“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”\n\nJesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:\n\n“‘The stone the builders rejected\n    has become the cornerstone;\nthe Lord has done this,\n    and it is marvelous in our eyes’?\n\n“Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”\n\nWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.",

Up to seven times?”\n\nJesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.\n\n“Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.\n\n“At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.\n\n“But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.\n\n“His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’\n\n“But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.\n\n“Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’ In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.\n\n“This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”",

    "description": "Luke 10:25-37 \n\nOn one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n\n“What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”\n\nHe answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”\n\n“You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”\n\nBut he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”\n\nIn reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’\n\n“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”\n\nThe expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”\n\nJesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”",

Where then did the weeds come from?’\n\n“‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.\n\n“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’\n\n“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”",
